# Work-In-Progress (WIP) Guidelines

## Limits
To ensure flow and focus, we enforce strict WIP limits:

*   **Per Person:** Maximum **2** tasks in `in_progress` state.
*   **Per Team:** Maximum **N+1** tasks in `in_progress` (where N is team size).

## Managing WIP
*   **Stop Starting, Start Finishing:** If you are at your limit, you must finish a current task or unblock a blocked task before picking up a new one.
*   **Swarming:** If a task is blocked or taking too long, other team members should swarm to help complete it rather than starting new work.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to the WIP limit must be:
1.  Discussed with the team/lead.
2.  Documented in `BITACORA.md`.
